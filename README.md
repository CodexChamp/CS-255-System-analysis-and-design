# CS-255-System-analysis-and-design
This is the product of 8 weeks of studying the process of analyzing systems and design. 
Within the class we were asked to create this as a way to slowly build up our porfolio. So to do that we have been given 
some questions to help us review how we felt about what we have done. :

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass project was a clients request to create a app/website that they can use to hel people have access to learning matierals
and ways to practice and earn how t drive. To prepare future drivers for things peoplearn t prepared for withon the driving test.
So i was tasked to analye what it is that they would like the sstem to do and determine all the specifics and functions necassary to fulfill
their requests. I also created diagrams and resources the programmers would use to begin creating the project after the clients approval.

What did you do particularly well?
I am confident that i was able to transer written dialogue of requests and aspects of the sysem into a fully fledged ot analysis. i felt i was comfotable understanding what it is that
the wanted and could fully flush it out and ask questions on things they them selves wouldnt have thought of. I also am happy with my understanding of diagrams and how to use them.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I Believe i would revise the client presentation. while i felt i kept techinical jargon withheld so that anyone could understand i lost a since of understanding
in my words and in some places i even wrote with technical jargon on accident. So since that is an important part of communications with clients and stake holders
i feel i should better myself in that area.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted the user's needs by conducting thorough research and gathering feedback from potential users such as the client and its employees. I focused on understanding
their expectations to ensure that the system design addressed their specific needs effectively. Implementing these insights into the system design involved prioritizing 
user-friendly features, intuitive navigation, and clear communication throughout the platform asa well as keeping in mind limitations like budget and time.
How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I as a student belive i have grown in my capabilites to think like a software engineer. When i am presented first with a project i thoroughly analyzing
the requirements and constraints of the project, breaking down complex problems into manageable components. I then would collaborate with stakeholders, including
clients and developers, to generate innovative ideas and validate design decisions though in this project we were solo we had discussions with fellow classmates and a paper that
was meant to resemble an interveiw. While what i am capable now was sufficent for this in the future, I plan to further enhance my skills in this area of expertise and others so i can be a vauable assest to a team.
